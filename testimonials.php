              <p class="text-left">After renovating our kitchen, I was left with an expensive faucet I couldn’t return. I emailed picSell and after 10 days it sold for $700. I was impressed – so I emailed pics of my Nokia Lumia 920. It sold after 2 hours for $250. Now picSell is my go-to-service for all my unused stuff! <h3 class="text-right"><small>--Gidon</small></h3></p>

              <p class="text-left">I was so excited when I recently upgraded my MAC computer and Apple iPhone. However, I didn’t know what to do with the old ones. I contacted picSell. All they asked, was that I send photos of the products I no longer needed. Incredibly, they both sold within three days. I got $400 for my computer and $220 for my old phone.  I was amazed. Now I find myself looking for all sorts of things that I no longer need, so I can sell them on picSell. <h3 class="text-left"><small>--Anne Sachs</small></h3></p>

              <p class="text-left">I had tons of stuff lying around that I did not have time to throw out or sell online, so picSell was a no brainer. It was so easy - I took a few pictures and sent them to picSell. Within 2 weeks, I sold two cameras, an espresso machine, a phone, two watches and a Viking kitchen hood. I netted a total of $3,550 just for items sitting in my house gathering dust! The process could not have been easier and now I am hooked!!... <h3 class="text-right"><small>--Avi C.</small></h3></p>
